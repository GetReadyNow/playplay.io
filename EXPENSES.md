### Playplay.io Expenses

Playplay.io is made possible by sponsors and open-source contributors. [Donate $100](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GEXDDK46JKGWN) and add your logo on [playplay.io](http://playplay.io) for a year. It's cheaper than running your own instance.
